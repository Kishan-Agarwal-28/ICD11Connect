# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Fixed!

## ✅ Backend Issues Resolved

The backend Netlify functions were not working because of:
1. **Import Dependencies**: Functions were trying to import external modules
2. **Function Structure**: Needed self-contained function files
3. **API Routing**: Incorrect path handling for Netlify

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### ✅ **Self-Contained Function**
- Created single `api.ts` function with all medical data embedded
- No external dependencies or imports required
- All types and storage logic included in function

### ✅ **Proper Netlify Configuration**
- Updated `netlify.toml` with correct redirects
- Fixed API path routing: `/api/*` → `/.netlify/functions/api/*`
- Added SPA fallback routing for React Router

### ✅ **Production Build System**
- `npm run netlify:build` - Complete production build
- Functions compiled to JavaScript with esbuild  
- Frontend built and optimized with Vite

## 📁 Current Structure

```
netlify/functions/
├── api.ts          # Source TypeScript function
├── api.js          # Compiled JavaScript function (deployed)
├── storage.ts      # Legacy file (not used)
└── schema.ts       # Legacy file (not used)

dist/               # Frontend build output

```

## 🌐 Deployment Ready

### **Option 1: Netlify Dashboard**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project" 
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `Kishan-Agarwal-28/ICD11Connect`
4. Netlify will auto-detect settings from `netlify.toml`
5. Deploy!

### **Option 2: Netlify CLI** (if you install it)
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod
```

## 🔗 API Endpoints (Production)

Once deployed, your API will be available at:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/search?q=grahani`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/namaste/code/AYU-DIG-001`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/icd11/code/1A00-1A9Z`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/tm2/code/TM-GI-001`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/mapping/code/NAMASTE/AYU-DIG-001`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/status`

## 🏥 Medical Data Available

### **NAMASTE Traditional Medicine Codes**:
- `AYU-DIG-001` - "Grahani Roga" (Ayurveda digestive disorder)
- `SID-DIG-003` - "Gunmam" (Siddha digestive fire disorder)  
- `UNA-RES-005` - "Nazla" (Unani respiratory condition)

### **Clean One-to-One Mappings**:
```
AYU-DIG-001 ↔ 1A00-1A9Z ↔ TM-GI-001
SID-DIG-003 ↔ 1A0Z ↔ TM-GI-002  
UNA-RES-005 ↔ J06.9 ↔ TM-RE-001
[And more...]
```
